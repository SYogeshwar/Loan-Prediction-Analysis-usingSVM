The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily 
put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors,
and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.
Loan Prediction Analysis using SVM gives the best accuracy on training data compared to other algorithms
